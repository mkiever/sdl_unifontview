README for sdl unicode font view
--------------------------------

These are the sources for unicodeview. A unicode font viewer
for the SDL platform.

This program is Copyright 2013 Matthias Kievernagel.
It is distributed under the GPL version 2 license.
For details see the file COPYING.

The distribution contains modified versions of the files
  SDL_ttf.h and SDL_ttf.c
from the SDL_ttf package (version 2.0.11)
which are Copyright (C) 1997-2012 Sam Lantinga <slouken@libsdl.org>
See COPYING_SDL_ttf for details about their license.

This is version 0.03. It is a very rough tool to look
at the glyphs in a font using SDL. The gridded display of 16x16
was chosen to accomodate unifont (http://czyborra.com/unifont/)
which has 8x16 halfwidth and 16x16 fullwidth bitmap characters.
Other fonts will probably not fit that grid and leave drawing artefacts.
There are no other options for gridded display yet.

I added a 'continuous' mode to look at other fonts. Mostly for
the cases where the gridded display just does not work.
In this mode glyphs will be added to a line while they fit.
Currently you can only move to the next page, there is
no moving back.

Some interesting fonts to look at:
  (Links checked 2013/09/24)
  The above mentioned unifont: http://czyborra.com/unifont/
  Aegean, Akkadian from http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/
  Most of the glyphs are outside of the BMP so use
    unicodeview -p 0x100 -m 3,10 'aegean.ttf'
    resp.
    unicodeview -p 0x120 -m 3,10 'akkadian.ttf'
  to view the interesting pages.

  Lots of fonts to find:

Usage
-----

   unicodeview [-g] [-c] [-p 'page'] [-m 'charmap'] 'ttf-font-file'

This will open the TTF file and display the glyphs of the font.
'-g' selects gridded view which shows the glyphs
in pages of 256 glyphs each (in a 16x16 grid).
At the top the page number is displayed as 3 hex digits.
The starting page can be given with the '-p' parameter.
Be careful to give hex numbers with the leading '0x'.
Otherwise it will be interpreted as decimal.
Gridded view is the default so '-g' normally is not
necessary.

'-c' selects continuous view mode
which puts glyphs in lines as long as they fit
and continues with the next glyph in new lines and pages.
The display ends at the last glyph and wraps
to the first glyph on the next page. You cannot
move backward in this mode. Use this mode if the
16x16 grid does not give satisfying results.

The '-m' parameter is a pair of numbers 'p,e',
platform-id 'p' and encoding-id 'e' to select a character mapping
in the font. Font files can contain more than one mapping of indices
to glyphs. The default mapping chosen by SDL_ttf
might not be what you want. Most of the time it chooses
'3,1' which is good for 16-bit Unicode (BMP).
Fonts for ancient scripts with code points behond 0x10000
may use '3,10'. So you should try this if your font
contains such glyphs. To find out about the character
mappings contained in a font you can use the utility
'ttfdump'. Look out for 'cmap' in the output.
If you follow this you can then find the corresponding
'SubTable's and see which glyphs are accessible with which
mapping. A resource to find out about the meaning of
the platform and encoding IDs is the header 'ttnameid.h'
of the freetype library.


Key bindings
------------

You can browse to other pages using '<' and '>'
(only '>' works in continuous mode).
The pages wrap at index '0xFFF' in gridded mode
and at the last glyph in continuous mode.
Use 'q' to quit the program.


Build and install
-----------------

To build and install the program use the usual
autoconf commands:

  > ./configure
  > make
  > make install

Building requisites are installed development files of SDL,
of the freetype2 library and of SDL_draw, a small drawing library for SDL.
It also uses a modified version of SDL_ttf 2.0.11, the ttf library
for SDL by Sam Lantinga. The modified sources are included here.
You can find the Copyright for SDL_ttf in the file COPYING_SDL_ttf.

I tested using the following versions of the packages:
  freetype2    -- 2.4.9  (debian 2.4.9-1.1)
  libsdl1.2    -- 1.2.15 (debian 1.2.15-5)
  SDL_draw     -- 1.2.13


Have fun,
Matthias Kievernagel
