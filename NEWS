sdl unicode font view news
--------------------------

2013-09-23: (version 0.03)
    Implemented a 'continuous' mode for glyph display
    to accomodate fonts with large differences in
    character width. This starts display with the first glyph
    of the font and fits as much glyphs in a line
    and as much lines in the window as possible.
    You can only advance (using '>') to the following glyphs
    until arriving at the last one. Next '>' will restart
    with displaying the first glyphs.

2013-07-05:
    With the inclusion of a modified version of SDL_ttf
    unicodeview can now display glyphs outside of the BMP.
    Command line parameters allow to go to a specific page
    directly and to select another character mapping
    (necessary for glyphs outside the BMP).

First packaging 26-06-2013.
